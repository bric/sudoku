This is a simple implementation of the popular sudoku game.

build instructions:
- you will need trolltechs qt4 framework which is available at least for
  windows, linux, Mac OSX
- if you want to use also the PDF export feature you will need to build
  and install also the libharu library which could be downloaded from
  http://libharu.org.
- configuration:
  to build the game without pdf export capability simple hit:
  > qmake
  to build with pdf export support use 
  > qmake OPTIONS+=pdf
- build:
  > make
- the game binary is build in the current directory and could be started
  via:
  > ./sudoku
  
history:

* 1.1a:  make pdf support optional
* 1.1:   improved algorithm, localization for germany, different levels and hint functinality
* 1.0.1: fix include header fault, only relevant if you compile sudoku under linux
